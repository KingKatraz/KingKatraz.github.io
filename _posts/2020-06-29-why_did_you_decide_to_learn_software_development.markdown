My name is Hal and I was born in the USA and raised in Haiti. Throughout my childhood, I was fortunate enough to have been able to interact with electronic devices and computers. It kind of made me curious about the inner workings of these devices and the power that resided in them. When I moved here in the US, this is where my relationship with technology deepened. I started taking job in Telecom marketing and sales which made me very aware of the power of coding. I had gotten a degree at Full Sail University in Music Business which is again  very tech heavy. I had the privilege of meeting coders and computer mavens, and saw what they did with that. I quickly understood that I had the potential to really make a difference in the world and change lives in a way that I never imagined before. I mean, let's be real, coding is as close as you get to the language of gods; so here I am, on my journey to Mount Olympus.
